# Upload Overview

The [Kendo UI Upload widget](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/upload/index) helps users send files from their file systems to dedicated server handlers which are configured to receive them and uses progressive enhancement to deliver an uploading user experience without the requirement of extra developer efforts.

## Basic Usage

The Upload provides a set of [default API configuration options](/api/javascript/ui/ipload) which can be set during its initialization such as synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation, chunk upload of files, multiple files selection and removal, progress tracking and in-progress cancellation of the upload, and so on.

> * The Upload does not currently support the upload of large files in chunks because the feature would require an additional Flash or Silverlight plug-in to compensate for the missing API support in older browsers.
> * The Upload works in `<input type="file" />` elements. Therefore, it can only upload files that are selected by the user and which exist in the file system. To upload files that are generated with JavaScript on the fly, use Ajax requests.

For the runnable example, refer to the [demo on the basic usage of the Kendo UI Upload](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/upload/index).

## Initializing the Upload

To initiate the Upload, use any of the following approaches:
* From an HTML `form` element.
* From an HTML `input` element of the `"file"` type.
* From a jQuery selector.

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the Upload. The array syntax in the `input` name is used to hint the Upload handler to treat the photos as an array. For more information on how to handle the uploaded files, refer to the documentation of your specific server technology.

    <!-- Kendo will automatically set the form `enctype` attribute to "multi-part/form-data" -->
    <form method="post" action="handler.php">
        <div>
            <input name="photos[]" id="photos" type="file" />
        </div>
    </form>

    $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#photos").kendoUpload();
    });

## Events

## Referencing Existing Instances

You can access an existing Upload instance by using the `.data()` jQuery method. After the reference is established, use the [JavaScript API reference of the Upload](/api/javascript/ui/upload) to control its behavior.

    var upload = $("#upload").data("kendoUpload");
